# Meta-Learning Deep Energy based Models

As part of the final course project (CS F441), I experimented with the approach presented in the [Meta-Learning Deep Energy-Based Memory Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02720) paper, in PyTorch.

**Note**: The code here is not an official implementation of the above paper, nor is it fully complete. It could work well only in certain situations but failed in other cases (see `Meta-Learning Deep Energy-based Models.pdf` to get a visual understanding). But it could serve as a good starting point for building more sophisticated models.
